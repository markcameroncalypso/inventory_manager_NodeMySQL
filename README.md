## Setup
### Prerequisites
```
*  Proficient JavaScript experience,
*  Basic knowledge of Node.js and the Command-line,
*  Basic knowledge of MySQL. 
```
### Installing
```
1) - Clone this repository to your local system.
```
 Use Git or checkout with SVN using the web URL. 
 [https://github.com/markcam1/inventory_manager_NodeMySQL.git]

_The relevant JavaScript files_:
1. __bamazonCustomer.js__: creates and manages the customer view (view inventory & purchase items/deplete inventory)
2. __bamazonManager.js__: creates and manages the manager view (View Products for Sale, View Low Inventory, Add to Inventory, Add New Product)
3. __bamazonSupervisor.js__: creates and manages the supervisor view (View Product Sales by Department, Create New Department)

 ```
2) - Install MySQL 
 ```
- If you do not have this installed, see the link to MySQL Tools [below](#tools) and install on your local system.
- Change your connection.js file to use the appropriate configurations. 
- Use your MySQL GUI or command-line application and run the SQL statement from the [DB file](#) or from the SQL statement below. 
- Insert data into the tables. Please create your own data or use my [csv file](#).

![mysql-connection](#)


```
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS bamazon;
CREATE DATABASE bamazon;

USE bamazon;

CREATE TABLE products(
  item_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  product_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  department_name VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
  price decimal default 0,
  stock_quantity INT default 0,
  product_sales decimal default 0,
  PRIMARY KEY (item_id)
);

CREATE TABLE departments(
  department_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  department_name VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
  over_head_costs decimal default 0,
  PRIMARY KEY (department_id)
);
```
The statement above was used for my database but if you are  with the functionality feel free to adjust it as you'd like.
For instance, the column product_name might not need to be 100 characters long as defined in [VARCHAR](http://sqlines.com/mysql/datatypes/varchar). 

```
3) - Install Node & Node Packages:
```
**node.js NOT installed**
Make sure node.js is installed on your machine by going to a terminal and typing:

>node -v

1. If it is not installed, please visit the [node.js](#tools) link and install it.
2. Then go to the root of this project and type:

> npm init

or additionally if you want to skip the questions, you can create a [default](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json) file, using: 

> npm init --yes

**node.js IS installed**
If you've cloned my repository to your local system then you notice:

1. package-lock.json
2. package.json

This means you can run the command:

>npm install

and install the packages I used to verify my code.

If you interested in learning about the difference between package-lock.json & package.json, 
you can read the [technical-specs](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-locks)] 
or a more [casual-description](https://medium.com/@Quigley_Ja/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-package-lock-json-b81911aa8ab8). 

**node.js packages**
If you are creating a repository from scratch, please see the packages I used for this project [below](#tools).
